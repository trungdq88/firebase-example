A web application to demonstrate Firebase features

See Firebase example with Realtime Database, Authentication, Storage and Hosting: https://github.com/trungdq88/firebase-checkin

Gameplay is similar to the famous agar.io game, but with controller, built with Firebase Realtime Database.

This game is design to play in a presentation for demonstration purpose.

- Dashboard: https://fir-example-c2211.firebaseapp.com/dashboard/
- Controller: https://fir-example-c2211.firebaseapp.com/dashboard/ (should be visited on phones or tablets)

*Notice:* game logic is calculated at client side in the dashboard screen, so if there is more than 1 dashboard screen opened, they will not sync!
